                    <p> Over a century ago, terror rained upon humanity
                        when monstrous giants named “titans” appeared and
                        mercilessly devoured humans.With no other choice, mankind
                        built large walls to barricade themselves safely in and
                        keep the Titans out .Decades later, Eren Yeager is a boy
                        that has grown up within the walls only knowing peace.
                        He and his friends, Mikasa and Armin, innocently
                        dream of exploring the vast world outside the walls.
                        But none except the military have ever left their safe
                        haven -- until the day comes when a colossal titan breaks
                        through the wall, and humanity’s peace is shattered to
                        ruins once again .

                    <p> Tokyo has become a cruel and merciless city—a place where
                        vicious creatures called “ghouls” exist alongside humans.
                        The citizens of this once great metropolis live in constant
                        fear of these bloodthirsty savages and their thirst for
                        human flesh. However, the greatest threat these ghouls
                        pose is their dangerous ability to masquerade as humans
                        and blend in with society.

                    <p> Light Yagami is an ace student with great prospects—and
                        he’s bored out of his mind. But all that changes when he
                        finds the Death Note, a notebook dropped by a rogue
                        Shinigami death god. Any human whose name is written in
                        the notebook dies, and now Light has vowed to use the power
                        of the Death Note to rid the world of evil. Will Light’s
                        noble goal succeed, or will the Death Note turn him into
                        the very thing he fights against?
