                        <span>Plot : </span><br>
                        Centuries ago, mankind was slaughtered to near extinction by monstrous humanoid creatures called titans,
                        forcing humans to hide in fear behind enormous concentric walls. What makes these giants truly terrifying is that their
                        taste for human flesh is not born out of hunger but what appears to be out of pleasure. To ensure their survival,
                        the remnants of humanity began living within defensive barriers, resulting in one hundred years without a single
                        titan encounter. However, that fragile calm is soon shattered when a colossal titan manages to breach the supposedly
                        impregnable outer wall, reigniting the fight for survival against the man-eating abominations.<br>
                        After witnessing a horrific personal loss at the hands of the invading creatures, Eren Yeager dedicates his life to
                        their eradication by enlisting into the Survey Corps, an elite military unit that combats the merciless
                        humanoids outside the protection of the walls. Based on Hajime Isayama's award-winning manga, Shingeki no Kyojin
                        follows Eren, along with his adopted sister Mikasa Ackerman and his childhood friend Armin Arlert, as they join
                        the brutal war against the titans and race to discover a way of defeating them before the last walls are breached.<br>

                    <p> Tokyo Ghoul is set in an alternate reality where ghouls, creatures that look like normal people but can only survive by eating human flesh,
                        live amongst the human population in secrecy, hiding their true nature in order toevade pursuit from the authorities. Ghouls have powers
                        including enhanced strength and regenerative abilities - a regular ghoul produces 4–7 times more kinetic energy in their muscles than a
                        normal human; they also have several times the RC cells, a cell that flows like blood and can become solid instantly. A ghoul's skin is resistant
                        to ordinary piercing weapons, and it has at least one special predatory organ called a kagune (Japanese: 赫子), which it can manifest and use as a
                        weapon during combat.<br>
                        In the case of a half-ghoul, only one of the eyes undergoes the "red eye" transformation. Natural born half-ghouls are very rare, and creating
                        half-ghouls artificially initially has a low success rate.
                        <br>There is also the case of half-humans, hybrids of ghouls and humans that can feed like normal humans and lack a Kagune while possessing enhanced
                        abilities, like increased speed and reaction speed, but shortened lifespans. Naturally born half-ghouls can also eat like normal humans or like full ghouls.
                        <br><span>Plot : </span><br>
                        The story follows Ken Kaneki, a college student who barely survives a deadly encounter with Rize Kamishiro, his date who reveals herself as a ghoul.
                        He is taken to the hospital in critical condition. After recovering, Kaneki discovers that he underwent a surgery that transformed him into a
                        half-ghoul. This was accomplished because some of Rize's organs were transferred into his body, and now, like normal ghouls, he must consume human flesh to
                        survive. The ghouls who manage the coffee shop "Anteiku" take him in and teach him to deal with his new life as a half-ghoul. Some of his
                        daily struggles include fitting into the ghoul society, as well as keeping his identity hidden from his human companions, especially from his best
                        friend Hideyoshi Nagachika.<br>
                        The prequel series Tokyo Ghoul [Jack] follows the youths of Kishō Arima and Taishi Fura, two characters from the main series who become acquainted
                        when they join forces to investigate the death of Taishi's friend by the hands of a ghoul, leading to Taishi eventually following Arima's path and
                        joining the CCG (Commission of Counter Ghoul), the federal agency tasked into dealing with crimes related to ghouls as well. The sequel series Tokyo
                        Ghoul:re follows an amnesiac Kaneki under the new identity of Haise Sasaki (the result of horrific brain damage sustained from Kishō Arima).
                        He is the mentor of a special team of CCG investigators called "Quinx Squad" that underwent a similar procedure as his, allowing them to obtain the
                        special abilities of Ghouls in order to fight them, but still being able to live as normal humans.<br>

                    <p> Death Note (デスノート, Desu Nōto) is an animated television series adaptation of the 2003 manga series Death Note.
                        One day,a shinigami named Ryuk, bored by the shinigami lifestyle and interested in seeing how a human would use a Death Note, drops one
                        into the human realm. High school student and prodigy Light Yagami stumbles upon the Death Note and—since he deplores the state of the world—tests
                        the deadly notebook by writing a criminal's name in it. When the criminal dies immediately following his experiment with the Death Note, Light is
                        greatly surprised and quickly recognizes how devastating the power that has fallen into his hands could be.<br>
                        <span>Plot : </span><br>
                        In the dark, desolate world of shinigamis (death gods), a bored shinigami named Ryuk decides to come to the human world. There, he drops his
                        Death Note, a book that shinigamis use to kill people. Anyone who's name is written in the Death Note will die within 40 seconds, and the time,
                        place, and method of death can also be controlled. Ryuk's Death Note is soon found by Light Yagami, an intelligent but insensitive high school
                        student. Since Light touched the Death Note, Ryuk becomes visible to him. Ryuk explains to Light how to use the Death Note (all the instructions
                        are also written in the book itself), and Light decides to use the Death Note's power to cleanse the world of all criminals and create a new,
                        "perfect" world.<br>
                        The unknown murderer, nicknamed "Kira," becomes a major news item, heralding both people who support and are against his "divine
                        punishment" of criminals. The police force finally decides to hire the legendary detective L to figure out exactly who Kira is. Kira's whereabouts
                        are traced back to Japan and Light's father becomes chief of the police force that is investigating Kira, totally unaware that his own son is the very
                        person he's seeking. A battle of wits ensues between Light and L, as Light becomes more obsessed with the Death Note's power and continues to baffle the
                        world with his mysterious, discreet murders, and L keeps getting closer and closer to discovering Kira's true identity. But in spite of L's wits being a
                        good match for his own, Light remains confident in his task of using the Death Note to abolish evil in the world and create a new world with him as the "god."
                        Light's actions and further descent into obsession with the Death Note brings up the question of whether a single human being should ever be in possession of
                        such non-human power.<br>
